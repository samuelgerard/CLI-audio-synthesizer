Personal implementation of an audio synthesizer that uses a fork of javidx9's Noise maker module as a base to generate signals from the computer

Note: This was developed in windows and Visual Studio, other OS/systems however, I'm unsure of the result

- Played in the command line
- Functioning ADSR
- Drum loop (Has to be modified in-line)
- Variety of artifically(synth) generated instruments such as a harmonica
- Uses threads to manage the activation of different 
- full 12-tone keyboard that uses your computers keyboard
